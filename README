libburrow
=========

This project provides an asynchronous C library for interacting with a Burrow message queue server. See: http://burrow.openstack.org/

Status
------

This is an early-release version of the library. Major functionality is
in place, and functional, but there are doubtless bugs, quirks, kludges,
and goblins hiding in the code.

Use with caution.

Maintainer Setup
----------------

If you didn't download this as a tarball, you probably pulled it from
a souce-control repository. In that case, please run:

  # ./config/autorun.sh
  
That'll setup the autotools environment.

Compilation
-----------

Now that your autotools environment is set up (or if you downloaded this
as a tarball), please run:

  # ./configure
  # ./make && ./make install

To install the library.

Tests
-----

Tests are located in the tests/ subfolder. To run test applications, please run:

	$ make check

This will compile and run test files. (Note: new files must also be added to Makefile.am, by modifying check_PROGRAMS).

You may find yourself wanting to run a test in gdb. You may find yourself wanting to run code coverage. Well, we can do all this and more! Supported commands of further interest:

  $ make check-valgrind  # run tests thru valgrind
  $ make check-gdb       # run tests thru gdb
  $ make lcov            # run tests and calculate line coverage
                         # make sure you first ./configure --enable-coverage

Functional Tests
----------------

These haven't been implemented yet, but eventually will, under examples/. More notes to come in the future.
