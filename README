libburrow
=========

This project provides an asynchronous C library for interacting with a [Burrow][2] message queue server, a part of [OpenStack][2].

Status
------

Implementation of this client library has just begun, and the design of its interface is ongoing. **You should not use it for any purpose at this time.**

Please see the [Burrow documentation][1] for more information about the design of the message queue service.

Compilation
-----------

This repository is set up for maintainers, not users at the moment. This means that libburrow will not simply ./configure && make. Instead, after you retrieve the repository, you must set up the autotools environment. First, make sure you have automake, autoconf, and libtool installed. Then, inside the root project directory, run:

	$ autoreconf # this will probably fail the first time around, that's good
	$ libtoolize
	$ automake --add-missing
	$ autoreconf # this should succeed, maybe with some output

You are now able to run ./configure, and make after that.

Tests
-----

Tests are located in the tests/ subfolder. To run test applications, please run:

	$ make check

This will compile and run test files. (Note: new files must also be added to Makefile.am, by modifying check_PROGRAMS).

You may find yourself wanting to run a test in gdb. You may find yourself wanting to run code coverage. Well, we can do all this and more! Supported commands of further interest:

  $ make check-valgrind  # run tests thru valgrind
  $ make check-gdb       # run tests thru gdb
  $ make lcov            # run tests and calculate line coverage; make sure you ./configure --enable-coverage

Functional Tests
----------------

These haven't been implemented yet, but eventually will, under examples/. More notes to come in the future.
