*  PROJECT:  memory backend for libburrow C client API.

*  AUTHOR:   Federico Saldarini - TEAM C - Capstone Team D
*  NOTE:     This should be considered a rough sketch at this point. 
*            Super cheap O(n) implementation.
***************************************************************************

This will eventually become the official memory backend for the C client API. Right now, it's merely a half-functional sketch.

Issues still to resolve:
------------------------
1. format to return messages (call-back, struct, implicit,etc..)
2. subtle behavior of "iterator" of sorts.
3. whether there is a need for a more efficient internal storage structure ( aka < O(a+q+m) )
4. go for robustness = return NULL whenever something goes wrong?
